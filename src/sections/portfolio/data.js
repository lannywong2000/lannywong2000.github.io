        desc: "Scientific experiments in the real world are very time and resources consuming. If only better results can be reached with fewer physical experiments conducted. This project performs a retrospective study on a drug response dataset and explores the feasibility of reducing physical experiment quantity while optimizing the result by harnessing the power of Active Learning.",
